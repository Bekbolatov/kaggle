One of the biggest issues is mispellings.
Can't just blindly apply dictionary, since sometimes brand names.

1. Create a dictionary of valid names from descriptions and attributes.
2. Use that as a soft whitelist when applying typo-correction
3. Bring everything into a singular nouns 
4. Consider stemming completely - but probably not a good idea - since most queries are nouns anyway.
5. Proceed with cleaned queries.
